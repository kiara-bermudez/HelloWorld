## Notes

A challenge I faced when completing this project was getting an understanding of the layout of android studio. Due to all of the differing screens, files and components, 
I had to spend time going through everything from the xml files to the kotlin files and the design area to understand what was going on in my app. I also had to spend
a lot of time figuring out how to correctly start the emulator on my computer because it ended up crashing a few times. I was able to get the emulator working
on my computer and I was able to display the app on my phone as well.
